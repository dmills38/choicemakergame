            Welcome to *world name*. In this world violence and trickery are sadly a common way of life. 
      Brought on by eons of war, the current citizens of *world name* tragically can not recall what life was like 
      before the endless bloodshed. Through endless war two families have risen above the rest becoming the two main 
      players vying for control of all of *world name*. Sadly these two familes, house Syther and house Mordom both 
      relish in the dark arts, and although they may have different customs and beliefs, their end game remains the same: 
      COMPLETE CONTROL OVER LIFE AND FREEDOM.
