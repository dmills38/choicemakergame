        <p id="storyLine">You open you eyes, head pounding like a drum. As your vision comes into focus, you realize you are in a small room of some kind. To your left you notice a old wooden door slightly ajar. You can see some light breaking through the opening and what sounds like rain coming down onto the other side. Straight ahead you see a staircase leading upstairs to another door. What path will you take?</p>
        <button id="btnOne">Take the stairs and discover what awaits you upstairs.</button>
        <button id="btnTwo">Take the door to your left and see what awaits you outside.</button>
