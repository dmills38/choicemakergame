            You open your eyes, head pounding like a drum. As your vision comes into focus, you realize you are in a small room. 
            To your left you notice an old wooden door slightly ajar. You can see some light breaking through the opening and what 
            sounds like rain coming down onto the other side. Straight ahead you see a staircase leading upstairs to another door. 
            What path will you take?
        </p>
        <button id="btnOne">Take the stairs and discover what awaits you upstairs.</button>
        <button id="btnTwo">Take the door to your left and see what awaits you outside.</button>
